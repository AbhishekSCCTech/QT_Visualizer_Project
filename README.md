# QT Visualizer Project

This project is a 3D visualization tool built with C++ and Qt. It is designed to read, render, and manipulate geometric data from various 3D file formats, such as STL and OBJ. The visualizer can display complex geometric structures, making it useful for applications in 3D modeling and computer graphics.

## Features
- **3D File Support**: Import and export support for STL and OBJ files.
- **Geometry Manipulation**: Includes classes for 3D geometry objects, such as points, triangles, and transformations.
- **OpenGL Rendering**: Uses shaders to render 3D models with customizable settings.
- **Data Synchronization**: Coordinates data between geometry and the visualization tool.

## File Structure
- **Geometry Module**: Contains classes and functions for 3D geometry manipulation.
- **Visualizer Module**: Handles file reading, data synchronization, and OpenGL rendering.

## Example Output
Below is an example output from the visualizer:

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Install Qt and set up the development environment.
2. **Build**: Compile the project using Qt Creator or any compatible C++ IDE.
3. **Run**: Execute the built application to start visualizing 3D models.
